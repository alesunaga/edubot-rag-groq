📘 Tutorial: EduBot RAG (Groq Edition)

Practical Guide for Teachers and Educators

Welcome to EduBot RAG! This version has been optimized to be fast, free, and unlimited. We use Groq technology (ultra-fast chips) for the brain and your own computer for the memory.

1. Advantages of this Version

No Daily Limits: Upload as many books as you want. "Reading" happens on your PC.

Extreme Speed: Near-instant answers to keep the class flowing.

Didactic Focus: Choose between Instructor, Partner, or Assistant.

2. Single Step: The Groq Key

You only need one free key:

Go to: console.groq.com

Create an account with your email.

In the left side menu, click on "API Keys".

Click on "Create API Key" and give it a name (e.g., "School").

Copy the code starting with gsk_... and save it.

3. Installation

Download the Project:
Clone or download the files from the official repository:
👉 github.com/alesunaga/edubot-rag-groq

Open the terminal in the downloaded folder.

Type:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Note: The first time, it may take a few minutes to download the "memory model" (approx. 80MB).

4. How to Use in Class

Run the command: python -m streamlit run rag_chatbot.py

Paste your gsk_... key in the side menu.

The system will automatically load the newest models (e.g., Llama 3.3).

Loading Material:

Simple (Short Text): Use for small texts (1-10 pages). It is instant.

Advanced (Books): Use for large files. Your computer will process it (may take a few seconds), but then the query is immediate.

Golden Tip:
Always keep the "🔒 Strict Mode" option checked to ensure the robot does not invent answers outside the PDF.
